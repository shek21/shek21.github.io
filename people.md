## PI

#### Seokki Lee, Assistant Professor
My research area focuses on database systems, specifically data provenance over big data. I have two main research pillars: (i) Efficient provenance management for providing concise and meaningful explanations for complex queries and workflows over large amounts of data; (ii) Developing provenance models to enhance explainability across diverse domains, with a particular focus on applications in machine learning (ML), privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), and data visualization.
