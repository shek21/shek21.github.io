## Seokki Lee, Assistant Professor (PI)
My research area focuses on database systems, specifically data provenance over big data. I have two main research pillars: (i) Efficient provenance management for providing concise and meaningful explanations for complex queries and workflows over large amounts of data; (ii) Developing provenance models to enhance explainability across diverse domains, with a particular focus on applications in machine learning (ML), privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), and data visualization.

### Short Bio
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology under supervision of [Dr. Glavic](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~dbgroup/members/bglavic.html) and Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Hanyang University.
